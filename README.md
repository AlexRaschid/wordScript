This Project is to help people that don't know how to code or have trouble understanding code to make coding easiler by using keywords to create start code.
We built this project by using HTML,CSS and javascript.
The challenges we ran into is how to get the display to look like real programing sites with the numbers
We learned a lot with a text editor libary called ACE
What next with this project is corporate more software language
